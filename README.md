# githubSoftuni
I have the necessary qualities and skills and willingness to develop in the chosen specialty. I have been involved in front-end development for 2 years and I am interested in improving my knowledge. I have completed some courses in the SoftUni academy (Java Script-basic, Java Script-fundamentals, Java Script-Advanced). I have also been attending specialized private lessons for front-end development (HTML, CSS, Java Script) at https://azprogramiram.bg for a year.
